# NOTE: DON'T USE THIS FORK . This is still work in progress!!!!!

# NOTE: The [original project](https://github.com/mirasrael/daemons-rails) is not currently under support and looking for man who ready to get care of it

Daemons Rails support (based on http://github.com/dougal/daemon_generator)
================

To get it work just add dependency to this gem in your Gemfile.

## NOTES ##

- **If you switched from earlier version to 1.2 its recommended to change `Daemons.run` to `Daemons::Rails.run` in your `*_ctl` files**
- **If you switched from earlier version to 1.1 you may need to move `script/daemons` file to `lib/daemons` directory.**

## GENERATOR ##

    rails generate daemon <name>

Then insert your code in the lib/daemons/\<name\>.rb stub. All pids and logs will live in the normal log/ folder. This helps to make things Capistrano friendly.

## CONTROL ##

Individual control script:

    ./lib/daemons/<name>_ctl [start|stop|restart|status]
    rake daemon:<name>[:(start|stop|restart|status)]

Examples:

    rake daemon:test - runs lib/daemons/test.rb not daemonized
    rake daemon:test:start - start daemon using lib/daemons/test_ctl start
    rake daemon:test:stop - stop daemon using lib/daemons/test_ctl stop
    rake daemon:test:restart - restart daemon using lib/daemons/test_ctl restart
    rake daemon:test:status - show running status for daemon using lib/daemons/test_ctl status

App-wide control script:

    ./lib/daemons/daemons [start|stop|restart|status]
    rake daemons:(start|stop|status)

## MONITORING API ##

    Daemons::Rails::Monitoring.statuses - hash with all daemons and corresponding statuses
    Daemons::Rails::Monitoring.start("test.rb") - start daemon using lib/daemons/test_ctl start
    Daemons::Rails::Monitoring.stop("test.rb") - start daemon using lib/daemons/test_ctl stop
    Daemons::Rails::Monitoring.controllers - list of controllers
    Daemons::Rails::Monitoring.controller("test.rb") - controller for test.rb application

    controller = Daemons::Rails::Monitoring.controller("test.rb")
    controller.path # => lib/daemons/test_ctl
    controller.app_name # => test.rb
    controller.start # => starts daemon
    controller.stop # => stops daemon
    controller.status # => :not_exists or :running    

## CONFIGURATION ##

You can set default settings for your daemons into config/daemons.yml file. Full list of options you can get from documentation to Daemons.daemonize method (http://daemons.rubyforge.org/classes/Daemons.html#M000007). Also it possible to set individual daemon options using file config/\<daemon_name\>-daemon.yml.
If you want to use directory other than default lib/daemons then you should add to application initialization block following lines:

    class MyApp < Rails::Application
        ...
        Daemons::Rails.configure do |c|
            c.daemons_path = Rails.root.join("new_daemons_path")
        end
        ...
    end

If you change your mind, you can easily move content of this directory to other place and change config.
Notice: this feature available only from version 1.1 and old generated daemons can't be free moved, because uses hard-coded path to lib/daemons. So, you can generate daemons with same names and then move client code to generated templates.

## USING MULTIPLE DAEMON SETS ##

At this moment it is not supported at generators and rake tasks levels, but you can generate daemon to default location and move to different folder (you should also copy *daemons* script to same directory). Then you will be able to operate with them using following scripts:

    other/daemons/location/daemons [start|stop|restart|status]
    other/daemons/location/<daemon_name>_ctl [start|stop|restart|status]

To access the daemons with Monitoring API you can use configured instance of *Daemons::Rails::Monitoring*:

    Daemons::Rails::Monitoring.new("other/daemons/location")

and same set of methods. Effectively, *Daemons::Rails::Monitoring* just delegates all method calls to *Daemons::Rails::Monitoring.default* initialized with configured daemons path.

## CHANGES ##

* 1.2.1 - add `rake daemon:<name>:restart` command
* 1.2.0 - development dependency on Rails bumped to support Rails 4 (dmilisic). Removed direct dependency on Daemons gem from generated files (in preparation for more daemonization providers)
* 1.1.2 - fix script template to load environment within Rails.root directory. It takes no effect on already generated scripts.
* 1.1.1 - fix dependencies, clean-up specs
* 1.1.0 - supported custom directory for daemons, support multiple daemons directories
* 1.0.0 - changed api for Daemons::Rails::Monitoring, fixed path in template for script, improved documentation, added RSpec
* 0.0.3 - added rake for running script without daemonization (rake daemon:\<name\>)
